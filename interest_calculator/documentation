Process for running flask to html and css:

First create project folder, then put the python file under this folder
in the terminal type: "pip install flask"

Create two subfolders called static and templates
under the template folder create the html files
under the static folder create another subfolder called 'styles'
under the styles folder create the css stylesheet


to link the html to the stylesheet, put this in the head element:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/style.css') }}">
replace the name of the style sheet at the end with name of actual style sheet

in the flask file input this line to reference and run the style sheet in live view:
app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path='/static')

in the flask file, reference the style sheet with this line
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
